    Object oriented Programming makes coding closest to the real world
    Objects are similar to real world entities that have both state (properties) and behavior (methods)
    Class: A blueprint for creating objects
    Example: We can say that Saman is an object of Human class
             Saman has hobbies (property), goal(property)
             Saman can walk (behaviour), fight (behaviour), eat (behaviour)
    OOPs is a coding paradigm, it is not confined to any particular language

    Inheritance: A child class can inherit the properties and behaviour from a parent class, and can have it's very own properties as well.
                 For example: Male class can inherit from Human class.
    
    Polymorphism: method overriding and method overloading, constructor overloading

    Encapsulation: Managing access of classes

    Abstraction: hiding the implementation

    Interfaces: blueprint for classes with no implementation. A class should implement all the methods declared inside a interface it inherits from.

    In C++, main() function can exist without any class, so it is often considered as not a true OOP language
    In Java and most of the other programming languages, everything is written inside classes. 

    Example: (java)

    public class Program {
    
       public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello World");
       }
    }

    Example: (C#)

    public class Program {
    
        public static void Main(string[] args) {

            Console.WriteLine("Hello World")'

        }
    }

    Java and C# are considered totally as OOP langauges
    C++ supports all programming paradigms

    Example: Original Form (class) --> Account creation form in SBI that resides in the headquarter 
             Original form is only one, it can have many copies (objects, instances)

    If you want to change anything, just make the change in the class, and it will be reflected in all the instances
